/**
 * Class for ReedcrmTicketDashboard
 *
 * The dashboard splits its indicators in two families, and every label says which one it belongs to:
 * - flow indicators (created, closed, messages, logged time) only count what happened inside the selected period,
 * - stock indicators (backlog, age, unassigned) always describe the tickets open right now, a backlog has no period.
 *
 * The closed tickets can be left out of every figure: the dashboard then only reads the tickets still open, and the
 * indicators that can only be measured on a closed ticket are not displayed at all rather than displayed empty.
